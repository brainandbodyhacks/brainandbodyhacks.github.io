# Applying neuroscience at work
## Change your brain to change your performance

Your brains ability to change is neuroplasticity
Your brain can form new brains cells called neurons or connections between neurons
Yo ucan change your brain

WHen we look at brainscans we can see the before and after of mindset changes

A brain scan can show you that a certain region has become smaller or bigger and it can show the blood flow in these areas

Small things can help when you feel stressed out:
- sleeping better
- eating better
- listening to music

Tell yourself and your team that you can change your brain even if you cannot change the situation. Your brain can always change for trhe better 
and this will help you perform better at work.


Gartner predicts:
"By 2021, 25% of companies will adopt neuroscience to enhance people development"
