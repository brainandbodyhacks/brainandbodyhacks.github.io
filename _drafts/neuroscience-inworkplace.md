# Applying neuroscience at work
## Change your brain to change your performance

Your brains ability to change is neuroplasticity
Your brain can form new brains cells called neurons or connections between neurons
Yo ucan change your brain

WHen we look at brainscans we can see the before and after of mindset changes

A brain scan can show you that a certain region has become smaller or bigger and it can show the blood flow in these areas

Small things can help when you feel stressed out:
- sleeping better
- eating better
- listening to music

Tell yourself and your team that you can change your brain even if you cannot change the situation. Your brain can always change for the better 
and this will help you perform better at work.

How to utilize this at work:
- Change your Training Design
    - add more learning that impacts the unconscous brain
    - Decision Making, creativity are highly unconscious
- Deepen understanding of soft skills
- Debunk old coaching practices
    - reserch indicates that constantly tracking goals overactivates the release of adrenalin in the brain, people become anxious and that slows them down
    - Even negative feedback can be helpful if it is carefully delivered
    - soft skills training backed up with neuro-education 
- add nuances that make a big difference


Gartner predicts:
"By 2021, 25% of companies will adopt neuroscience to enhance people development"
