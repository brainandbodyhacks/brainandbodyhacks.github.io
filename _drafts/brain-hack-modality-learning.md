4. Use your motor system when learning something new

“If you want to learn something, try to put it in as many modalities of neural function as possible. For example, when I was learning something new, I would always write in the margin notes. Even though I never read the notes again, the act of putting it into my motor system helped me to remember the facts.”

> “Our brain has evolved to move through the world and one of the things that has come out of the field in the last 50 years is that the motor system has all of this beautiful interaction with the sensory stations in the brain, these more cognitive stations. 
So engaging those circuits has this chance of really fortifying memories onto parts of the brain.” Dr Adam Hantman, Janelia
