# Quotes of the day

##  Be your future self now - BENJAMIN P. HARDY


> "Everyone has a plan until life punches them in the face. 
Whatever punches life gives to you, your past is just a story. 
Whatever story you choose for your past enormously impacts your present and your future. 
When you frame the past negatively, your goals become reactive to and based on your past."


> You will be the same person in five years as you are today except for the people you meet and the books you read.” 
- Charlie Jones, Business strategist


> "By proactively changing your inputs of information, experiences, and people, you become aware of what you previously didn’t know. 
> You see what you previously didn’t notice. 
> You seek what you previously didn’t want. 
> You act in ways you previously didn’t behave."


> "..your Future Self is the byproduct of your environment. Being mindful enables your environment to be the result of your conscious choosing. Choose well."


> "..most people don’t spend much time thinking about their Future Self. Caught up in the short-term dopamine of the present, like randomly scrolling through social media, binge eating, or binge spending, seeking short-term rewards creates long-term costs. When you engage in short-term reward seeking that produces negative long-term consequences, then you’re costing your Future Self. 


> Everything you do is either a deficit to or an investment in your Future Self. 
> Do you want your Future Self to be broke and unhealthy, or fit and free?
