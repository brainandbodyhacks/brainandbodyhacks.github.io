“When you take charge of your life, there is no longer a need to ask permission of other people or society at large. When you ask permission, you give someone veto power over your life.” - Geoffrey F. Abert

## Goal
Learn what games people play and how you can break this loop and improve your relationship and communication.
Clearly state what you need instead of playing the game of "the victim, rescuer and villain."

## Steps

1. Spot the game
2. Identify your go to role - victim, rescuer or villain
3. Avoid the trigger or hook, refuse to play the game
4. Move to assertive, caring and vulnerable 
5. Identify your life script

**How to**
- from persecutor to assertive: use assertiveness to offer constructive challenge to help others to develop. 

- from rescuer to caring: Rescuers show their caring side, listening to others and helping them to find their own way. 

- from victim to vulnerable: Victims accept their vulnerability and realise they have agency too. They take responsibility and become problem-solvers. 


- Stop complaining and acting like a victim. 
- Refuse to let others rescue you and ask directly for what you want from others. 
- stop listening to their complaints. 
- When they play the victim: ask them, “What do you want from me?”
- Do not contribute to making anyone into a bad guy.
- Do not take sides.
- Do not ignore or discount feelings.
- Do not discount the importance of the situation.
- Do not create secrets.
- Do not rescue.
- Do not play the "two against one" game.

When somebody is angry
- “I can see that you are upset/angry/sad because ...” 
- “It’s hard when ..You’d like to ...”
- "Do you need anything from me right now?”
- "I am available to support you to solve this.."

When somebody plays the victim
- "What options do you see..?
- “Are you willing to.."
- “You look like you could use a hug. Would you like a hug?”

When sombody accuses you
- “Thank you, I am aware of that” or “Thank you, I wasn’t aware of that.”

When somebody does not listen
- “I don’t believe you heard me. Would you please listen to what I am saying?"
