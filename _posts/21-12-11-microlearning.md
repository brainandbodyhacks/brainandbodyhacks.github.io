Why Microlearning?
</div>

Learn what microlearning is about and how and when to use it.
Let's dive deeper.

# Goal
Mia works in the software department of a huge company. She has a calling: she loves to learn about each and everything. She loves to grow and find efficient solutions to the problems of today’s busy world. 
She also wants to share her knowledge and to help people to find solutions on their own, to constantly grow and continuously learn to make their lives easier.

There is only one problem: people don’t have time. No time to listen, no time to learn. They are caught up in all the top priorities in their work place and the busy ever-changing world they live in.

Mia is asking herself, whether there is a way to respect these circumstances but still provide methods to learn and grow in the modern world?
She reads a lot about the concept of continuous learning and this new thing called MICROLEARNING.


## Why microlearning?
Mia learns that microlearning is a method that provides small learning units  which can be consumed in a very short time and at any time by the learner, so that he is able to finish a unit in one go. Microlearning bites also can fit into a greater learning objective, where the learner can connect the dots of the small bites to the greater picture.

She reads how studies have shown that microlearning can be more efficient in transferring knowledge than the classic training. Furthermore, information delivered in short, focused chunks is easy to learn and  to remember as research has shown.
As she digs deeper, she understands that the formats to apply microlearning are quite diverse, such as quizzes, short stories, flashcards, infographics, GIFs, short videos, tip sheets or podcasts.

 Mia is starting to believe that this approach could be a powerful tool to address the “busyness problem” in the context of learning.

## How to put it into action ?
Mia reflects on all the tasks her team has to solve and all the passion and time they are investing into their work. She wonders, how she can help them to make learning manageable and fun. Mia decides to take small steps and designs an experiment. She wants to provide small learning bites about microlearning for a week in her team. The learning goal for this week would be to learn about microlearning. Each day a learning bite can be consumed by the team members.

She writes a short story about her problem, the potential solution with microlearning and the actions to take. She divides the story into 3 chapters, each a learning bite. She also creates a crisp infographic as a separate bite. For the last part, she provides a short quiz, where the team can assess what they have learned in a short and fun way.

Mia is now eager to evaluate the experiment together with her team and is ready to inspect and adapt on the learnings.

# Take aways
In a nutshell, microlearning is a nice addition to other formats, since it enables to learn anything at anytime and everywhere in small digestable bites.
However, it is important to connect it with context and dig deeper to understand topics in depth.
