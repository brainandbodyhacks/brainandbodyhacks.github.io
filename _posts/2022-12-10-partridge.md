Partridge with Pasta and Carrots!

# Recipe
We wanted to have something different from chicken this time, so we gave the partridge a try.

# Steps
## Follow the instructions

- Remove all the giblets.
- Remove any feathers with tweezers
- Add fat on the skin, e.g. olive oil
- Season on the outside and on the inside with pepper and salt
- Gently cook in oven with low temperature
- Leave the meat to rest
- Serve with carrots, self-made noodles and orange-sauce
