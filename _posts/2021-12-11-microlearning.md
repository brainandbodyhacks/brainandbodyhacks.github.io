Today I learned what microlearning is about and how and when to use it.
Let's dive deeper.

# Goal
When I started my new job in the area of learning and upskilling in the tech field, I read a lot about microlearning.

# Steps
## Gather insights

I read all I could find about the term and stored :

* [What is Microlearning](https://www.ispringsolutions.com/blog/what-is-microlearning)

In a nutshell, microlearning is a nice addition to other formats, since it enables to learn anytime and everywhere with a very short effort.
However, it is important to connect it with context and show poeple how to dig deeper to understand topics in depth.
