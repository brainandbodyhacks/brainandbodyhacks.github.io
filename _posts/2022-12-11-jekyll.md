<div class="message">
My first post in a new Jekyll-based blog!
</div>

Today I learned how to setup a blog using Github pages and Jekyll.
Here is how easy it is to get started.

# Goal
I was already using GitHub to organize my personal work, so GitHub pages got my attention.
My goal was to set up an easy to maintain and simplistic blog to write my stories and share my learnings. 

# Steps
## Follow the instructions

I followed the quick-start tutorials on:

* [Jekyll docs](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/)
* [Jekyll tutorials](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/)

## Check examples

After setting up a very basic layout, I dived deeper into some of the existing examples and adapted 
step by step, using different layouts for pages and posts.

* Github repo with the sources of this blog can be found here: [https://github.com/vitalyrepin/vrepinblog](https://github.com/vitalyrepin/vrepinblog)

## Experiment

I roled up my sleves and experimented with advanced layouts, stylesheets, jekyll tags and much more.
I prefere to keep it simple, so for me the combination of GitHub pages and Jekyll works great.
Try it yourself!
