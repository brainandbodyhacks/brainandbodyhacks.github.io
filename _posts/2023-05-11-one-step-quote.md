# Quotes of the day
Here is one more eye-opening, inspiring book about good change. Read the notable quotes below.

##  One small step can change your life - Robert Maurer Ph.D.

**What It’s About:** The book discusses how to take small steps, ask small questions and think small thoughts and still achieve your goals. It debunks the myth that change has to be hard.

Notable Quotes:

> **Myth #1: Change Is Hard**

> "**..change—whether personal or in business—doesn’t have to be agonizingly painful. 
> Nor must it happen only as the result of scare tactics employed to shock ourselves—or our colleagues—into meaningful action.**


> **Myth #2: The Size of the Step Determines the Size of the Result**

> **low-key change** helps the human mind circumnavigate the fear that blocks success and creativity.

> large goal ➞ fear ➞ access to cortex restricted ➞ failure
> 
> small goal ➞ fear bypassed ➞ cortex engaged ➞ success

> **Your brain loves questions** and won’t reject them . . .
> unless the question is so big it triggers fear.

> when you ask small questions, your amygdala (where the fight-or-flight response occurs) will remain asleep, 
> and **the cortex, always hungry for a good time, will wake up and take notice.**
