##  Be your future self now - BENJAMIN P. HARDY

> "Everyone has a plan until life punches them in the face. 
Whatever punches life gives to you, your past is just a story. 
Whatever story you choose for your past enormously impacts your present and your future. 
When you frame the past negatively, your goals become reactive to and based on your past."
- BENJAMIN P. HARDY


> You will be the same person in five years as you are today except for the people you meet and the books you read.” 
- Charlie Jones, Business strategist


> "By proactively changing your inputs of information, experiences, and people, you become aware of what you previously didn’t know. 
> You see what you previously didn’t notice. 
> You seek what you previously didn’t want. 
> You act in ways you previously didn’t behave."
- BENJAMIN P. HARDY
