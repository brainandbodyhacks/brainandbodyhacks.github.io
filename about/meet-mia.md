## Meet Mia
Mia has a passion: she loves to [learn](/category/jumlearn/) about each and everything. 
She loves to grow and find efficient solutions to the problems of today’s busy world. 
She also wants to share her knowledge and to help people to find solutions on their own, to constantly grow and continuously learn to make their lives easier.

## A Day in the Life of Mia
Let Mia guide you through one of her typical days:

**Waking up:**

The alarm rings and I am rolling out of bed to grab my iPad and cuddle up on the cosy couch.
I open up the **"morning-flow"**, which is an automatically generated file with all things I want to digest in the morning. It contains the **weather**, the **fact**, **appreciation**, **recipe** and **joke** of the day, a random [**ted talk**](https://www.ted.com/) and [**big think**](https://bigthink.com/) blog and much more.
This way I am starting my day in a positive mood and at the same time with **big ideas** in mind.

**Breakfast:**

On a weekday I typically start my day with a simple tea and coffee with coco milk, though I love a longer breakfast on the weekend.

**Morning:**

The morning is typically filled with meetings to synch with my team of experts or holding **coaching** sessions. If possible, I try to integrate some **"meet&walk"** or short and simple workouts.
I like to be prepared and take time to work on drafts for compelling conference talks or bigger **workshops** with an efficient and engaging agenda.

**Lunch:**

I love an early lunch with food that gives me energy, such as beans with vegetables and feta or easy bowls or soups.

**Afternoon:**

The afternoon might start with more sessions or **experimental work** all around upskilling and learning.
I am eager to get new input on how to work smarter, not harder and I try a lot of new formats and methods to make life easier and to [simplify](/category/jumsimplify/).
Sometimes it is all about being creative and removing things that do not create value or joy.

**Evening:**

If we do not connect with friends or family, evenings are **JuMtime**! 
We try to [cook](/category/jumcook/) together, talk the day through and **plan the future**.
We draft ideas for small projects, such as beautifying our flat or organizing the next **trip**.
And at the end of the day, often a good **movie** takes us into another reality until we fall asleep and dream about our future adventures.

**Favourite Quotes:**
> "In order to control myself I must first accept myself by going with and not against my nature.” ― Bruce Lee

> "Once we focus, we can simplify."

> "Prioritize for energy"

> Don’t stay around where you’re not heard or not happy. Life goes by too quickly. Always plenty of opportunities out there."

Enjoy the JuMiverse, enjoy learning, enjoy your life!
