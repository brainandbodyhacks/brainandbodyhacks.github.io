## A Day in the Life of Mia

Welcome to our MuMiverse!
I am Mia, let me guide you through one of my typical days:

## Waking up
The alarm rings and I am rolling out of bed to grab my iPad and wrap up on the cosy couch.
I open up the "morning-flow", which is an automatically generated file with personal stuff:
- **weather** of the day
- **joke** of the day
- **fact** of the day
- **ted talk** of the day
- **big think** of the day
- **recipe** of the day
- **appreciation** of the day
and much more.
This way I am starting my day in a positive mood and at the same time with big ideas in mind.

## Breakfast
On a weekday I typically start my day with e simple tea and coffee with coco milk.
I love a longer breakfast on the weekend to start my day.

## Morning
The morning is typically filled with meetings to synch with my team of experts or holding coaching sessions. If possible, I try to integrate some "meet&walk" or short simple workouts.
I like to be prepared and take time to work on drafts for compelling conference talks or bigger workshops with an efficient and catchy genda.

## Lunch
I love an early lunch with energy food, such as beans with vegetables and feta or easy bowls.

## Stay tuned...
