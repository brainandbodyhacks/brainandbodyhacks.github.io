## A Day in the Life of Mia

Welcome to our JuMiverse!

I am Mia, let me guide you through one of my typical days:

**Waking up:**

The alarm rings and I am rolling out of bed to grab my iPad and cuddle up on the cosy couch.
I open up the **"morning-flow"**, which is an automatically generated file with all things I want to digest in the morning. It contains the **weather**, the **fact**, **appreciation**, **recipe** and **joke** of the day, a random **ted talk** and **big think** blog and much more.
This way I am starting my day in a positive mood and at the same time with **big ideas** in mind.

**Breakfast:**

On a weekday I typically start my day with a simple tea and coffee with coco milk, though I love a longer breakfast on the weekend.

**Morning:**

The morning is typically filled with meetings to synch with my team of experts or holding **coaching** sessions. If possible, I try to integrate some **"meet&walk"** or short and simple workouts.
I like to be prepared and take time to work on drafts for compelling conference talks or bigger **workshops** with an efficient and engaging agenda.

**Lunch:**

I love an early lunch with food that gives me energy, such as beans with vegetables and feta or easy bowls or soups.

**Afternoon:**

The afternoon is typically filled with more sessions or **experimental work** all around upskilling and learning.
I am eager to get new input on how to work smarter, not harder and I try a lot of new formats and methods to make life easier and to **simplify**.
Sometimes it is all about being creative and removing things that do not create value or joy.

**Evening:**

If we do not connect with friends or family, evenings are **JuMtime**! 
We try to **cook** together, talk the day through and plan our future.
We draft ideas for small projects, such as beautifying our flat or organizing the next **vacation**.
And at the end of the day, often a good **movie** takes us into another reality until we fall asleep and dream about our future adventures.
