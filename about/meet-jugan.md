# Meet Jugan
Jugan is a **modern McGyver**: 
he will find (sometimes unusual) solutions for almost any problem related to **craftmanship, electricty or maintenance of house and home**.
Let Jugan show you how he shapes his typical days:

## A Day in the Life of Jugan

**Waking up:**

I am an **early bird**, I typically wake up around 6 and like to read some news before I get up and shower.

**Breakfast:**

Next I will have short breakfast together with Mia before starting my workday.

**Morning:**

My mornings are either filled with meetings or reviewing documents, **designing** solutions or giving **architectural** advice.
Whenever I can, I try to move during meetings to get me thinking.
I am a **logical person** and like to **listen and think stuff through** before stating my opinion.
On a Saturday or Sunday I prefer to get out of the house as soon as possible and **move in the woods** together with Mia.
This calms me down and I can reflect the past week or think about the future.
I love to make **plans for traveling** or for events such as christmas.

**Lunch**

Lunch might be simple bread and sausage or leftovers from the day before.
I love to finish lunch with a strong **espresso**.

**Afternoon**

The afternoons are pretty similar to the mornings on a typical work day.
At the weekend they might be filled with **McGyver-ing**, such as building solutions for the **"smart home"**, preparing the **terasse** for spring, taking care about the little **garden** or experimenting with new **digital solutions**.

**Evening**

Evenings are **JuMtime** and I love to **cook** for Mia, **bake bread** and try out new ways to simplify life.
One example is what I call **lazy cooking**, where I prepare the meal for the next day already upfront.
I like to **optimize** my day and am always eager to find the best solution for everything. So sometimes I tend to overthink.
I am a **family person** and really care about my inner circle, so I am always there for them and try to make them a priority.
