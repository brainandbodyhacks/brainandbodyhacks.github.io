How you can learn to tackle stress and insanity to survive before xmas
</div>

# Goal
Do you want to reduce the holiday stress, stay in control of your time and focus on the essence of cristmas? Here is how I struggled, learned and found a way:

My emotions about christmas are mixed.
The idea to slow down and connect with your loved ones is appealing.
But when reality hits you, things look different.
The days befor christmas are filled with busyness which is pushing poeple to limits at times. And when poeple reach their limits, conflicts might be the consequence.
So for quite a while, I have been thinking about how to get out of the hamster wheel before christmas, how to simplify life again and focus on the important stuff.

# Steps
## Clearly picture your ideal christmas
My ideal of christmas is to slow down and give mind and body some rest.
Listening to piano or violine songs and cuddling up in a blanket with some hot tea calm Mia down and she gets back energy. And what a nice experience to step into a white winter wonderland and breath in the fresh air, get cold a bit just to heat up again afterwards at home.
What comes in the way are all the real or sometimes imaginary duties we fill our lifes with: 
- Buying presents because it is the tradition, not because you just found something that reminds you of your sibling.
- Or visiting all the xmas markets with friends and collegues, even if you feel your body needs rest
- Or stuffing the whole family together in one room, overeating without moving and eventually bringing up topics that bear conflict.

I read a lot about how to avoid these artificial duties, focus on precious time, calming down and listening to your needs.

## Manage expectations & set boundaries
Here is the essence of what I learned:
Often poeple think that they are not in control of their needs and time. Too many requests and events are leaving us with too many decisions on where to go, how long to stay and how much money to spend. Obligations at work and deadlines at the end of the year are not helping either.

Thus it is so important to set boundaries. Without boundaries, everyone loses.  

Before we commit to anything, we need to set our boundaries and ask ourselves: 
what are our limits in terms of time, money and energy. We need to make our boundaries explicit and create a plan that works for us and our inner circle.

## Focus on what you can control
You can control to make your needs transparent. What is joy for one individual can be horror for the other, so we need to make this clear. How can we expect from others that they read our minds?
Your needs are as valid as other poeples needs, its not black and white, they can live in parallel as long as we do not violate the boundaries of others.
And to avoid that, we need to know those boundaries!

## Take some time out and say No
We also need to articulate, what is "off the table". Say "No" if a request violates your boundaries - at work or in private life. You need to say No if your health is at risk or you do not have enough energy anymore - as the latter often leads to the former. If you are not healthy, you can hardly spread joy and help others.

## Get enough sleep
Prioritize your sleep!
Sleep is the one "magic pill" that restores health in your brain and body and that works like a battery pack to give back energy. Avoid to constantly run on low battery and get enough sleep.

## Make a budget and stick to it
In terms of money: Make a budget and stick to it. Or even better: Gather presents over the year on occasion. Look out for things that your loved ones might like, every day. If you make that a habit, you always have something in stock to give away with love and not under pressure. 
The rarest thing we have is time, so think about it as a precious gift as well.

# Take aways
You can be in control of your time, this is not selfish, it is wise!
When we feel in control, we can enjoy what we chose. And we give because we want to and not because we feel forced to.
Here is my wish: Take more control over your time, health and life, especially at those busy times.
