<div class="message">
A one week experiment.
</div>

# Goal
I want to be autonomous using self-efficacy.
I want to live with intention and design my future.
So this experiment will be about wishes I have for myself.
I will be clear about my wishes, state them each day and fullfill them myself.
Thus my wishes need to be about stuff, that I can influence myself. 


# Steps
For one week:
1. Wake up and reflect on my wishes
2. Fulfilling them by the end of the day

Wish | Mo | Tue | Wed | Thu |Fr|
--------|-------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |
 Wish 1 | :ok: |  |  |  ||
 Wish 2 |:ok: |    |   |  |  | 
 Wish 3 |:ok: |    |   |  |  | 

## Day 1
The alarm goes off by 6 o clock.
Of course I am sleepy, but I open up the shades and also let in fresh air.
I tell myself my wish: I wish to get up so that I can be ready with breakfsat before 7, so I can use the time to invest in my health. I count to 5 and off I go.
First wish granted, yeah!

The second point wish I have is to write a blog post in the mroning. 
I just granted myself this wish and wrote a blog post about my [no-mail-experiment](2023-02-05-no-mail-experiment.md)
Second wish granted, yeah!

The third one is a bit more tricky: I want to focus on my #futureskill of the day: today it is #leadership.
So whenever throughout the day I have the chance to practice #leadership, especially to help others to grow, I will take the chance.

# Take aways
Just follwoing the routine to not check messages first thing in the morning definetly helped to focus on the more important things and staying out of the hamsters wheel at least for an hour.
However, it is hard to defend my time and focus in the morning with already scheduled meetings.
I have done the first step towards productivity. 
As a next experiment I will get up one hour earlier for a week to combine this experiment with really having focus time for creative work first thing in the morning.
