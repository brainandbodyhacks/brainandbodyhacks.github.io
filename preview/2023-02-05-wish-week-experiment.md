<div class="message">
A one week experiment.
</div>

# Goal
I want to be autonomous using self-efficacy.
I want to live with intention and design my future.
So this experiment will be about wishes I have for myself.
I will be clear about my wishes, state them each day and fullfill them myself.
Thus my wishes need to be about stuff, that I can influence myself. 


# Steps
For one week:
1. Wake up and reflect on my wishes
2. Fulfilling them by the end of the day

Wish | Mo | Tue | Wed | Thu |Fr|
--------|-------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |
 Wish 1 | :ok: |  |  |  ||
 Wish 2 |:ok: |    |   |  |  | 
 Wish 3 |:ok: |    |   |  |  | 

## Day 1
The alarm goes off by 6 o clock.
Of course I am sleepy, but I open up the shades and also let in fresh air.
I tell myself my wish: I wish to get up so that I can be ready with breakfsat before 7, so I can use the time to invest in my health. I count to 5 and off I go.
First wish granted, yeah!

The second point wish I have is to write a blog post in the mroning. 
I just granted myself this wish and wrote a blog post about my [no-mail-experiment](2023-02-05-no-mail-experiment.md)
Second wish granted, yeah!

The third one is something, I can only influence partially: 
I am sharing my learnings in an interview style with a small team of Scrum Masters. The goal is to make them curious and then ask them, if they would like to join and actively participate.
l wish, that we can at least reach 1 Scrum Master.
The result at the end of the day: all of them want to join in. What a great outcome, I am humbled and surprised that my wish is granted!


## Day 2

## Day 2
Since I went to sleep with a headache last night, my first wish for today is to take care about my brain. I wish to do so by taking deep breaths of fresh air outside every couple of hours. I take the first step in the morning outside of the terrasse- check.

The second one is a bit more tricky: I want to focus on my #futureskill of the day: today it is #leadership.
So whenever throughout the day I have the chance to practice #leadership, especially to help others to grow, I will try to focus on them and let them shine, but also challenge them in a kind way.
So 
- saying "Thank you" or just 
- giving them the stage 
are behaviours I can practice today to fullfill this wish.

The third wish is rather tough, it is about helping others. I have a tendency to jump in first whenm help is needed and since I have a lot of meetings today, there might be a couple of hidden traps. With the focus on #leadership and letting others shine, I wish to also get myself out of the helpers-syndrom and try to not offer help today if it does not help to support others to grow.
So my wish is to ask myself: 
- Do they really need my help here or am I playing the rescuer? 
- Would it help them more, if they figure it out by themselves and does that in return help them to grow? 

At the end of the day, did I grant myself the wishes ?
