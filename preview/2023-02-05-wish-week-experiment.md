<div class="message">
A one week experiment.
</div>

# Goal
I want to be autonomous using self-efficacy.
I want to live with intention and design my future.
So this experiment will be about wishes I have for myself.
I will be clear about my wishes, state them each day and fullfill them myself.
Thus my wishes need to be about stuff, that I can influence myself. 


# Steps
For one week:
1. Wake up and reflect on my wishes
2. Fulfilling them by the end of the day

Wish | Mo | Tue | Wed | Thu |Fr|
--------|-------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |
 Wish 1 | :ok: |  |  |  ||
 Wish 2 |:ok: |    |   |  |  | 
 Wish 3 |:ok: |    |   |  |  | 

## Day 1

The alarm goes off by 6 o clock.
Of course I am sleepy, but I open up the shades and also let in fresh air.
I tell myself my wish: I wish to get up so that I can be ready with breakfast before 7, so I can use the time to invest in my health. I count to 5 and off I go.
First wish granted, yeah!

The second wish I have is to write a blog post in the morning. 
I just granted myself this wish and wrote a blog post about my [no-mail-experiment](2023-02-05-no-mail-experiment.md)

The third one is something, I can only influence partially: 
I am sharing my learnings in an interview style with a small team of Scrum Masters. The goal is to make them curious and then ask them, if they would like to join and actively participate.
I wish, that we can at least reach 1 Scrum Master.
The result at the end of the day: all of them want to join in. What a great outcome, I am humbled and surprised that my wish is granted!


## Day 2

1. Since I went to sleep with a headache last night, my first wish for today is to take care about my brain. I wish to do so by taking deep breaths of fresh air outside every couple of hours. I take the first step in the morning outside of the terrasse - check.

2. The second one is a bit more tricky: I want to focus on my #futureskill of the day: today it is #leadership.
So whenever throughout the day I have the chance to practice #leadership, especially to help others to grow, I will try to focus on them and let them shine, but also challenge them in a kind way.
So 
- saying "Thank you" or just 
- giving them the stage 
are behaviours I can practice today to fullfill this wish.

3. The third wish is rather tough, it is about helping others. I have a tendency to jump in first when help is needed and since I have a lot of meetings today, there might be a couple of hidden traps. With the focus on #leadership and letting others shine, I wish to also get myself out of the helpers-syndrom and try to not offer help today if it does not help to support others to grow.
So my wish is to apply #curiosity, a skill included in #leadership, and ask myself: 
- Do they really need my help here or am I playing the rescuer? 
- Would it help them more, if they figure it out by themselves and does that in return help them to grow? 

At the end of the day, did I grant myself the wishes ?
1. Let's have a look at number 1: I did take time on the terrasse 3 times in the morning and after lunch as well as once in the afternoon.
The result: No headache and higher energy levels than the day before. Of course, there might be other factors to this and I will experiment a bit more with the breathing technique. But for today: wish granted.

2. Saying "thank you" or letting others shine looks easy on a day, where you don't pressure yourself to deliver - or in other words: when you do not feel like the responsibility is on you, you can let loose. But if you feel you should be in charge or if you believe, that you have to contribute by saying something smart, because otherwise it will let you look bad, it is another story.
For today, I did not feel like the latter, so I need to practice more under tough conditions, so I focused on saying "thank you" and giving others the stage in some of my 1:1 meetings.

3. The third part is something that plays with my "triggers". 
It is always hard for me to say "No" if people are asking for solutions or expecting things of me, even if in the long term it does not help them. One example: I was asked to take over a workshop facilitation next week. Since I will be on vacation, it was easy for me to say "NO", but I did say "Yes" to finding some volunteer.
Now what was clear to me: Even if I would have had the time for the facilitation, I should have asked the question, if I was really helping them by saying yes. Of, course you want to help people out, but it is a pattern I often encounter, that an Agile Coach equals facilitation. A view I dare to question! As an Agile Coach I can bring in so many different tools, like coaching, teaching methodically, emporering others and many other things, but what people often only see in that role is: Facilitation. So by challenging this view, I have to say "NO" to facilitation more often and "Yes" to all the other things.
For today, I see my wish granted, but I will definitely need to stretch myself more to practice the routine of saying "No" to let other people find a solution.


## Day 3
Wish 1: I want to keep up the breathing routine from day before, do it at least once per 2 hours.
At the end of the day I can say, I did pretty much reach my goal by just going on the terrasse or opening the window and breath in fresh air.

Wish 2: Todays #futureskill is selfcare. Since my day is full of meetings, I need to be careful with my energy. I wish to listen to my body's signals and react to them, when I am out if energy.
When reflecting on this wish in the evening, I am quite satisfied, since I did take a very short na -just closing my eyes- after lunch to reenergized, which worked well. I also worked on some creative task between 2 meetings with music on. 

Wish 3:
I did not add any further wish this day and took it slow.


## Day 4
1. My first wish today is to follow up with #leadership skills as mentioned above: **I wish to lift others up, ask curious questions and listening actively.** I wish to do so with my ambassador community and involve them by asking for their ideas. I will also do an interview today, where I try to hold back and listen closely.

2. My second wish for today is related to the quote
> "Be yourself and say what you feel. The ones who bother do not count and the ones who count won't bother."
I want to get rid of the "freak out after speak out" where I ruminate about what I have said in a meeting and how others would perceive it. 
For today I want to use a trick: 
whenever I have the tendency to "punish" myself for what I have said or done, I will use my "trigger-pic" - which will be Lisa Bilyeu's and her clonk-clonk-clonkety-clonk - frickin' quotes: 
> **"You can be a kind person with a warm heart and still tell people to eff off when needed."**

3. The last wish is very much related to the above: I will set and defend my boundaries and still be kind. That will be tough and it will be a journey. I will start today by **NOT involving in things that are not related to my top 3 priorities.**


## Day 
1. Today is Skillâ€”mapping workshop time. My wish is to focus on my part of explaining the value stream - asking about the previous knowledge, e.g. do it quiz style or with video - and then proceed with observing only.

I will also repeat wish 2 and 3 from yesterday:

2.  **"You can be a kind person with a warm heart and still tell people to eff off when needed."**
3.  **NOT involving in things that are not related to my top 3 priorities.**

# Result


# Take aways
Be careful of what you wish for it might become true! 
If you frame your "shoulds" as wish it will seperate what you really want from things that you think you must do.

**#intentuition**: follow your intuition to live a life by intention.

**#staycurious** **stayhealthy**
