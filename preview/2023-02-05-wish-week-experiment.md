<div class="message">
A one week experiment.
</div>

# Goal
I want to be autonomous using self-efficacy.
I want to live with intention and design my future.
So this experiment will be about wishes I have for myself.
I will be clear about my wishes, state them each day and fullfill them myself.
Thus my wishes need to be about stuff, that I can influence myself. 


# Steps
For one week:
1. Wake up and reflect on my wishes
2. Fulfilling them by the end of the day

Wish | Mo | Tue | Wed | Thu |Fr|
--------|-------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |
 Wish 1 | :ok: |  |  |  ||
 Wish 2 |:ok: |    |   |  |  | 
 Wish 3 |:ok: |    |   |  |  | 

## Day 1

The alarm goes off by 6 o clock.
Of course I am sleepy, but I open up the shades and also let in fresh air.
I tell myself my wish: I wish to get up so that I can be ready with breakfsat before 7, so I can use the time to invest in my health. I count to 5 and off I go.
First wish granted, yeah!

The second point wish I have is to write a blog post in the morning. 
I just granted myself this wish and wrote a blog post about my [no-mail-experiment](2023-02-05-no-mail-experiment.md)
Second wish granted, yeah!

The third one is something, I can only influence partially: 
I am sharing my learnings in an interview style with a small team of Scrum Masters. The goal is to make them curious and then ask them, if they would like to join and actively participate.
l wish, that we can at least reach 1 Scrum Master.
The result at the end of the day: all of them want to join in. What a great outcome, I am humbled and surprised that my wish is granted!


## Day 2

1. Since I went to sleep with a headache last night, my first wish for today is to take care about my brain. I wish to do so by taking deep breaths of fresh air outside every couple of hours. I take the first step in the morning outside of the terrasse - check.

2. The second one is a bit more tricky: I want to focus on my #futureskill of the day: today it is #leadership.
So whenever throughout the day I have the chance to practice #leadership, especially to help others to grow, I will try to focus on them and let them shine, but also challenge them in a kind way.
So 
- saying "Thank you" or just 
- giving them the stage 
are behaviours I can practice today to fullfill this wish.

3. The third wish is rather tough, it is about helping others. I have a tendency to jump in first when help is needed and since I have a lot of meetings today, there might be a couple of hidden traps. With the focus on #leadership and letting others shine, I wish to also get myself out of the helpers-syndrom and try to not offer help today if it does not help to support others to grow.
So my wish is to apply #curiosity, a skill included in #leadership, and ask myself: 
- Do they really need my help here or am I playing the rescuer? 
- Would it help them more, if they figure it out by themselves and does that in return help them to grow? 

At the end of the day, did I grant myself the wishes ?
1. Let's have a look at number 1: I did take time on terrasse 3 times in the morning and after lunch.
No headache and higher energy levels than the day before. Of course, there might be other factors to this and I will experiment a bit more with the breathing technique. But for today: wish 1 granted.

2. Saying "thank you" or letting others shine looks easy on a day, where you don't pressure yourself to deliver - or in other words: when you do not feel like the responsibility is on you, you can let loose. But if you feel you should be in charge or if you believe, that you have to contribute by saying something smart, because otherwise it will let you look bad, it is another story.
For today, I did not feel like the latter, so I need to proactice more under tough conditions, so I focused on saying "thank you" and giving others the stage in some of my 1:1 meetings.

3. The third part is something that plays with my "triggers". It is always hard for me to say "No" if people are asking for solutions or expecting things of me, even if in the long term it does not help them. One example: I wask ask to take over a workshop facilitation next week. Since I am on vacation, it was easy for me to say "NO", but I did say "Yes" to finding some volunteer.
Now what was clear to me: Even if I would have had the time for the facilitation, I should have asked the question, if I was really helping them by saying yes. Of, course you want to help people out, but it is a pattern I often encounter, that an Agile Coach equels facilitation. A view I dare to question! As an Agile Coach I can bring in so many different tools, like coaching, teaching methodically, emporering others and many other things, but what people often see in that role is : Facilitation. So by challenging this view, I have to say NO to facilitation more often and "Yes" to all the other things.
For today, I see my wish granted, but I will definitely need to strecth myself more to practice the routine of saying "No" to let other people find a solution.
