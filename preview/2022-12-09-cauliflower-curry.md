This is one of Mias' favourites, it's fairly quick to make, healthy and delicious.

# Ingredients
For 1 serving:
- Onion, garlic, ginger
- 1 tsp coconut oil
- Coconut milk
- Broth
- Salt
- Pepper
- Turmeric
- 1 half cauliflower
- Carrots

# Steps

- Brush the pan with coconut oil
- Sweat onion, garlic and ginger
- Add turmeric
- Deglaze with broth and coconut milk
- Cook cauliflower and carrots until soft, about 15 minutes
- Salt and pepper

# Healthy because
Cabbage not only has a high vitamin C content, but also so-called glucosinolates, which are responsible for the typical aroma.
These substances protect our cells from free radicals, which promote diseases and also premature aging.
