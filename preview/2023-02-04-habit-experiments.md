> **A routine is just a structure that allows us to make time for the good stuff**, and shouldn't be another unrealistic expectation we place on ourselves.
After all, the perfect schedule doesn't equate to **living a perfect life. There is no such thing.** We needn't strive to follow another person's idealised routine in the hope of attaining their version of success. **All we can do is experiment with what works for us.**
