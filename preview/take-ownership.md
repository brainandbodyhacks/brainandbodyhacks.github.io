Learn what games poeple play and how you can break this loop and improve your reltionship and communication

# Goal
Clearly stating what you need instead of playing the game of "the victim, rescuer and villain."

1. Spot the game
2. Identify your go to role
3. Avoid the trigger or hook, refuse to play the game
4. Move to assertive, caring and vulnerable 

- from persecutor to assertive: use assertiveness to offer constructive challenge to help others to develop. 

- from rescuer to caring: Rescuers show their caring side, listening to others and helping them to find their own way. 

- from victim to vulnerable: Victims accept their vulnerability and realise they have agency too. They take responsibility and become problem-solvers. 

5. Identify your life script
