##  One small step can change your life - Robert Maurer Ph.D.


> **Myth #1: Change Is Hard**

> "**..change—whether personal or in business—doesn’t have to be agonizingly painful. 
> Nor must it happen only as the result of scare tactics employed to shock ourselves—or our colleagues—into meaningful action.**


> **Myth #2: The Size of the Step Determines the Size of the Result**

> **low-key change** helps the human mind circumnavigate the fear that blocks success and creativity.

> large goal ➞ fear ➞ access to cortex restricted ➞ failure 
> small goal ➞ fear bypassed ➞ cortex engaged ➞ success

> **Your brain loves questions** and won’t reject them . . .
> unless the question is so big it triggers fear.

> when you ask small questions, your amygdala (where the fight-or-flight response occurs) will remain asleep, 
> and the cortex, always hungry for a good time, will wake up and take notice.


> Your Brain Loves Questions
