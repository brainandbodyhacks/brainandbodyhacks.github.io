</div>

# Mixed-paella
This dish tastes like vacation and it reminds JuM of their times in Barcelona, where big fat paella pans are made from fresh ingrediants and with a lot of time.

# Ingredients
For 2 servings:
- 75 g shrimps or mixed seafood (crabs, mussels, squid etc.)
- 250 g chicken breast fillet
- 4 cherry tomatoes
- 1 bell pepper
- 1 onion, garlic
- 80 g paella rice
- tomato sauce
- 1/2 liters of chicken broth
- 100 ml dry white wine
- 1 tsp paprika powder
- 1 tsp turmeric
- Salt and pepper, saffron threads
- Olive oil
- 1 lemon

# Steps
- Thaw chicken breast and shrimps
- Cut chicken breast into cubes
- Saute chicken breast in olive oil
- Add garlic and onions
- Add broth and white wine
- Add tomato sauce
- Add rice
- Add bell pepper and other veggies
- Season with spices such as parika powder, tumeric, salt, pepper
- Let simmer for half an hour, stir gently
- Serve with saffron threads and lemon

# Healthy because
Garlic and onions possess anti-fungal and anti-bacterial qualities. 
The lean protein from seafood and chicken give your body all the building blocks it needs. 
And spices like saffron and tumeric not only give a special taste but also have an anti-inflammatory effect.
